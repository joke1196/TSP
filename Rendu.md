###6.1 - Problem (TPS)
The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city? It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science.
The objective of this exercise is to solve the TSP problem for a set of 14 cities in Burma, officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. The following vectors give the GPS position of each city.
